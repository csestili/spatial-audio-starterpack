# spatial-audio-starterpack
A tiny Unity project to get you started making immersive experiences with spatial audio.

## Why?
Music that takes advantage of *space* as a compositional element is really cool. There is [a long history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_music) of music composed with space as a central focus.
However, many potential listeners don't have speaker setups in their home that allow them to appreciate spatial music.


Fortunately, a *video game* is a great format to expose listeners to spatial audio. The only equipment
required is a computer and a pair of headphones. No special knowledge is required to set up anything.

This is a starter project to make a simple video game with spatial audio.
The only thing you have to do to get started is to replace the audio clips in this package with your own audio.

## What's in the box?
This short video demo (click image for video) shows everything included in this project:

This scene contains:
- 4 cubes that emit spatialized audio
- a first-person character controller that can look and walk around
- a little bit of lighting and set dressing to make it look nice

This is already enough to begin exploring quadraphonic (4-speaker) audio.

## How do I get started?
1. Download [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open this project in the Unity editor.
4. Edit the project by:
- Changing the audio that each cube emits.
- Changing the position of each cube.
- Adding more cubes by duplicating the existing ones.
